<h2>What happens on an undergraduate open day?</h2>
The undergraduate open days offer the chance for prospective students to see what life at the University of Wolverhampton is all about. You’ll have the opportunity to visit the campuses, buildings, and facilities, and to speak to staff and students about what the university has to offer. 

You’ll be able to speak to staff in different subject areas, too. If you are unsure which course to take, the undergraduate open day is the perfect chance to learn more about the academic schools, ctheses, and what’s involved.

Can’t attend?
If you can’t attend the undergraduate open day, we offer virtual tours, where you can explore the campuses and facilities from the comfort of your own home. We also offer campus tours, which give you the chance to see the campuses in person on a different date.
